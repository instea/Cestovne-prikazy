# Trips management

Application for management of trips.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* node
* docker, docker-compose (for database)

### Installing

Clone the repository
```
git clone ... ; cd trips
```

Start by installing the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

The application needs a running Mongo instance for it to work. It can be pointed to any such instance.
It can be set by setting the environment variable _MONGO\_URL_ to an url in this format:

```
mongodb://user:pass@localhost:port/database
```

If no mongo instance is readily available, the repository contains a docker compose file to quickly start a new instance:

```
pushd db
docker-compose up -d
popd
```

No authentication will be used by default. If it is required, read instructions at [mongo docker page](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/).

The application also requires some secret files that are not present in the repository:
* secrets/private.key - private key
* secrets/public.pem - public key

Those can be generated by running:

```
ssh-keygen -b 4096 -t rsa -f ./secrets/id_rsa -q -N ""
```

and then extracting the Base64 content into private.key and public.pem files.

## Running

You need to run the client and server application. Client side is run by issuing npm start command:

```
npm start
```

If using the dockerized mongo instance with no authentication, the server can be run by this command:

```
npm run server
```

Otherwise, mongo url needs to be set:

```
MONGO_URL=mongodb://user:pass@localhost:port/database npm run server
```
